    "REST Architecture\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "1. Client-Server: REST application should have a client-server architecture. A Client is someone who is requesting resources and server is someone who holds the resources and are not concerned with the user interface or user state.\n",
    "2. Uniform Interface: There should be an uniform way of interacting with a given server irrespective of device or type of application (website, mobile app). \n",
    "3. Stateless: It means that the necessary state to handle the request is contained within the request itself and server would not store anything related to the session\n",
    "4. Cacheable: Every response should include whether the response is cacheable or not and for how much duration responses can be cached at the client side.\n",
    "5. Layered system: An application architecture needs to be composed of multiple layers. Each layer doesn’t know any thing about any layer other than that of immediate layer.\n",

    "-----------------\n",

    "1. Service Provider: The collection of software that provides a web service.\n",
    "2. Service Requester: The collection of software that is responsible for requesting a web service from a service provider.\n",
    "3. Service Registry: It is a central location where service providers can publish their service descriptions and where service requesters can find those service descriptions.\n",
